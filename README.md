# udemy-web-dev-bootcamp
My first real repository and my files for the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp Course

I started this course in May, 2017.  I work full time and have a family to take care of so my progress will likely be slow but I will be posting the project files here as I complete them from now on.

As I write this, I am on lesson 39.

June 3, 2017 Update
Just finished the Yelp Camp Exercise for lesson 76.  Files have been added here though I didn't use all of the unique image URL's from the end of the lesson.  No time for busy work ;)

June 7, 2017 Update
Passed Lesson 100 which was a little exciting for me.  Getting into JavaScript.  Tricky stuff but sticking with it.

June 12 Update
Functions are hard!  I'm not uploading my work for the Functions Problem Set because I didn't ever get 2 of the 3 working right.  Even after following along with the solution tutorial, mine are still showing errors in the console.  I will need to be aware of the fact that I didn't fully grasp this but I'm moving on.  I feel like I did understand the big picture with the functions but I'm sure there are some mistakes in my code that I will have to work out eventually.

June 27 Update
I've uploaded my files for the ToDo Lsit but I didn't get that working right either.  I took a couple week break to move from NM to MA and I felt like I remembered quite a bit when I came back to this.  So I'm happy about that.  But I cannot find where I haven't copied this code exactly, yet mine is not running right.  I will come back to this one as well.  Very frustrating.  And I just noticed that my last note from a couple weeks ago is that I didn't get that one right either.  Maybe later this week I will go back to both and try to tackle again.

July 5 Update
I'm ready to get back to a regular schedule of working on this but feel like I have already forgotten so much of the Javascript.  I'm going back to redo the section from the beginning so I won't be posting much here until that is done.  I hope I will also figure out the those last couple mistakes that I was making.  I hate to move ahead when I have errors in what was already done.

July 11 Update
I've been working through the lessons pretty quickly and skipping the ones that I'm confident I know or have good notes on.  I redid the ToDo list exercise that I had trouble with and it is working now.  The new files are in the ToDo List folder with a "2" on them.  Still having trouble finding why this one works and the first one didn't when I compare the two files.  But moving on cause, well, it works.

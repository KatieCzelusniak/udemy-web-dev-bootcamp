# udemy-web-dev-bootcamp
My first real repository and my files for the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp Course

I started this course in May, 2017.  I work full time and have a family to take care of so my progress will likely be slow but I will be posting the project files here as I complete them from now on.

As I write this, I am on lesson 39.

Just finished the Yelp Camp Exercise for lesson 76.  Files have been added here though I didn't use all of the unique image URL's from the end of the lesson.  No time for busy work ;)

Passed Lesson 100 which was a little exciting for me.  Getting into JavaScript.  Tricky stuff but sticking with it.
